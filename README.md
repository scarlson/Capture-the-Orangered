# Capture-the-Orangered

This was one of my first decent sized Go projects, and maybe the 5th or 6th webgame I've built.

I've added the project to github because I no longer intend to do anything with it, but a lot of the code is still useful for me (the control schemes, for example). If it's useful for me, there may be others out there who could find use in looking how I handled game logic in Go with a web frontend.
